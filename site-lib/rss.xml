It was an idea heavily inspired by gems such as "Slay The Spire", "Hearthstone", "Slice and Dice", and "Morimens".
The gameplay features tight resource management in a low-math, high-keyword environment, giving a couple of anchor points to make your own character and their deck unique and powerful, whereas the Setting provides plenty of opportunity for "angsty" or "against all odds" roleplay in a grimdark world, where magic is ubiquitous, but hope is scant.Once, there was HELL. Every day, souls passed in and out, getting incinerated and sent to the Hall of Echoes, pure. One day an apocalyptic event happened. Because of that, HELL is working overtime and is still centuries behind. Because of that, Souls get clogged up in the in-between, and that radiation is called magic, which seeps into the living. Until finally, their bodies can't take it anymore, and burn up from the inside.*The LORE dropdown is a good place to start for anyone curious about the world and the gritty reality found therein, ex.: <a data-href="VIBE" href="lore/world/vibe.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VIBE</a>.
For the Rules Lawyers: here's the short end of it, as the detailed rulings fall under their own dropdowns, labelled BS, DS, or CHARACTER.Once a concept of who you'd like to play as forms in your mind, the preferable place to go is the CHARACTER&gt;OATHS Section, where you'll find all three major Oaths (which function like classes, and determine your starting Attributes - Prisms), these in turn determine your Starting Deck.<br>
All Oaths start with 10 <a data-href="BACKBONE" href="character/cards/backbone.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">BACKBONE</a> cards making up their deck, but the keywords may vary based on chosen Oath and even subtle differences between the same Oath's decks are possible at times.<br>
Now, having a concept, embodied by an Oath, and a Deck, you select your <a data-href="BURST" href="character/oaths/burst.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">BURST</a>, and your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="CHARACTER/OATHS/CRUCIBLE/PASSIVES" data-href="CHARACTER/OATHS/CRUCIBLE/PASSIVES" href="character/oaths/crucible/passives.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PASSIVES</a> (Each Oath offers a different selection). These are the anchor points mentioned before - they'll define your playstyle heavily.
Once that's in order, and your friends have done the same, you're set!
(Don't forget to send at least 4 sentences worth of a backstory to your GM, though.)

This allows the GM to create "impossible" threats that require specific card or behaviour answers.
An enemy's "Statblock" is essentially their Intent Loop/Algorithm + their HP.
Ex.:
Husk - 7 HP
Intent: Strike (6) -&gt; Guard (8) -&gt; Strike (8) -&gt; Guard (12) -&gt; LOOP.
This makes enemies predictable (rewards knowledge/experience and learning), and decreases GM's mental load drastically, while keeping the players on their toes whenever they meet something new.
Enemies are tracked through an special sheet - the Intent Table

Veins, fingernails, and even eyes may begin glowing in red/yellow hues. That's the usual sign of magic accumulation, which, if left untreated, can cause burnups ("treating it" means releasing the magic outward, which itself has a chance for burning the person, but also their surroundings if uncontrolled)
Usually the Hearth's bond is enough to allow for venting as well as controlled releases of build up magic, but ice, water, and other means of staying cool are also in play
The "end product" of the magic's effect on a human body is being turned into a Hollow - a husk-like zombie-like shell of a being A Hollow isn’t undead in the usual sense. That implies animation, will, or purpose. This is worse. Magical collapse = total loss of soul containment. What remains is: A body whose tissues have been thermally vitrified from the inside out. A mind erased by overload. A shell still moving because the residual soul-heat hasn’t dissipated yet.
The Collapse Timeline
Stage 1: The Burnups Chronic fever, ash coughing Skin cracking like fired clay Emotional flattening
Fire responds too easily People at this stage know what’s coming.
Stage 2: Breach One moment too much: A stored surge A panicked release A battlefield spike The soul-boundary fails. This is not an explosion. Explosions release energy outward. This is an implosion that's powerful enough to hit the outside too. Memory, identity, intent — gone, into the <a data-href="GREY MIST" href="lore/world/physical-pillar/grey-mist.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">GREY MIST</a>.
Stage 3: Hollowing (fractions of a second after Breach)
Organs char but don’t fail completely Blood thickens into slag Nerves fire randomly from thermal stress The heart becomes a smouldering knot The person is already dead. The body just hasn’t realized it yet.
Stage 4: The Hollow Walks A Hollow: Avoids nothing Attacks nothing deliberately Moves toward thermal gradients — crowds, fires, battlefields Why? Because residual soul-heat seeks other heat to equalize with. Hollows drift toward the living. That’s why they’re exterminated on sight. Moral Baseline Shift When everyone knows: Collapse is possible Hollows exist And they were people yesterday The moral bar drops. “I’m a liar. I’m a cheat. But I haven’t collapsed.” That’s enough. Bravery gets you: Overexertion Battlefield surges Collapse Cowards: Flee early Hoard less power Survive.
There is no redemption in collapse. No lesson. No chosen fate.
A Hollow isn’t punished, sinful, or unworthy.
They’re what happens when the system fails.<br>

Uncontrolled release doesn’t just burn the caster — it disturbs the local atmosphere.
Side effects: Fire behaving wrong (screaming flames, fire that resembles faces) Attracting Hollows Creating permanent hot zones<br>

Hell isn’t full because too many people sinned - That’s propaganda. Hell is full because it was designed as a furnace, a bottleneck for the deceased, not the final destination. Souls entered Hell to be broken down, identity stripped, meaning burned off, residual energy vented safely.
At some point: The inflow exceeded processing capacity the furnace mechanisms failed
Hell stopped processing souls and started storing them.
Consequences?
Pressure builds, exhaust backs up, heat leaks. That leak is magic.

7. Why They’re Exceptionally Powerful
Power isn’t skill.
It’s lack of restraint mechanisms.
No bond damping
No social checks
No institutional oversight
No long-term planning
They burn hot, fast, and wrong.
And they know it.
Which makes them terrifyingly honest. ]]></description><link>lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/cinders.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">LORE/WORLD/CULTURAL PILLAR/FRACTIONS/CINDERS.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:17:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[WET RATS]]></title><description><![CDATA[Black Market Releases, the best alternative to the <a data-href="CRS" href="lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/crs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CRS</a>

Portable release charms.

They set up facilities of cold stone and water to allow for safe venting, as well as taking in the "terminal" cases, which they handle out back.
They wear layered uniforms, like toxic hazard workers. High-status, low-life-expectancy, trained to read early collapse signs.

Witchhunt-like inspections

The cost of power is life. Embers suffer a shortened lifespan, burning their years away the moment this flame blooms within them for the first time. Despite that, it's a gift, one that manifests randomly and powerfully, and comes at a horrid price.
Players are called Embers, groups of bonded Embers are called Hearths. This bond acts as a "Resonance Buffer," preventing the individuals from "detonating" or collapsing into a Hollow state.
Hearths can form due to: Rituals done by the Embers themselves, or even without the Embers' choice/knowledge via grimoires or other artifacts.
Life experiences: a Bond is likely to form during a shared traumatic event, or, for the lucky ones, it can build up after years of closeness with one another. Bonding with other Embers allows for cleaner channelling - which translates nicely into extra energy per party member.
Because Embers forget their pasts (due to <a data-href="LORE/WORLD/CULTURAL PILLAR/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION" href="lore/world/cultural-pillar/religion-philosophy/erosion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">LORE/WORLD/CULTURAL PILLAR/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION</a>), they often lack a traditional moral compass. They act on instinct, immediate survival, or the orders of whoever is currently guiding them. Partially. Hearth-members (Embers) are known to have blurry memories and little recollection of who they were before the "merge". The bond between them can also be strengthened or weakened by individual interactions, even to the point of breaking (which is a traumatic experience on its own)
Everyone in a hearth is a bit of an anchor to everyone else. Usually the other members are enough to "ground" whoever's having a tough time, but in times of high stress the emotions may get amplified/cascaded
<br>Yes! It is rare to survive a bond breaking, but those who do are called <a data-href="CINDERS" href="lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/cinders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CINDERS</a>, and often lose their grip on reality, turning away from society altogether
Probably the second one. I'd imagine them being like social programs, which quickly turn into military ones
The most impressive and threatening Embers are those who can output the most, at the smallest cost to their vitals
The "Ship of Theseus" Dilemma:&nbsp;If a Hearth replaces a member who died, does the new member eventually "absorb" the residual memories of the previous occupant? This could lead to haunting internal monologues where an Ember cannot distinguish their own childhood from that of a dead stranger.
Cascading Failure:&nbsp;If emotions are amplified/cascaded during stress, a single member’s panic attack could theoretically "overclock" the entire Hearth, leading to a collective burnup. This makes emotional discipline as vital as magical talent.
Hearths: Distributed Containment (And Why 3–5 Is the Sweet Spot)
A Hearth is a living heat-sharing network.
Soul-binding isn’t mystical romance. It’s engineering under duress.
Why It Works (When It Does)
Heat disperses across multiple vessels
Panic dampens if others are stable
Emotional regulation is forced by proximity
Individual spikes become manageable averages
You didn’t choose 3–5 by accident. That’s perfect:
2 is unstable (feedback loop)
6+ increases coordination failure
3–5 balances redundancy and control
Someone absolutely did the math. On corpses. ]]></description><link>lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/hearths-and-embers.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">LORE/WORLD/CULTURAL PILLAR/FRACTIONS/HEARTHS AND EMBERS.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:12:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[THE EARTHBOUND]]></title><description><![CDATA[These zealots believe in extremist pacifism, claiming that every life spared and death delayed brings HELL closer to catching up, and ridding the world of magic and <a data-href="GREY MIST" href="lore/world/physical-pillar/grey-mist.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">GREY MIST</a>.<br>

Hearths: Distributed Containment (And Why 3–5 Is the Sweet Spot)
A Hearth is a living heat-sharing network.
Soul-binding isn’t mystical romance. It’s engineering under duress.
Why It Works (When It Does)
Heat disperses across multiple vessels
Panic dampens if others are stable
Emotional regulation is forced by proximity
Individual spikes become manageable averages
You didn’t choose 3–5 by accident. That’s perfect:
2 is unstable (feedback loop)
6+ increases coordination failure
3–5 balances redundancy and control
Someone absolutely did the math. On corpses. ]]></description><link>lore/hearths-and-embers.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">LORE/HEARTHS AND EMBERS.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:35:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EROSION]]></title><description><![CDATA[Magic doesn’t want to be inside you.
5. Actually veins, fingernails, and even eyes may begin glowing in red/yellow hues. That's the usual sign of magic accumulation, which, if left untreated, can cause burnups ("treating it" means releasing the magic outward, which itself has a chance for burning the person, but also their surroundings if uncontrolled)
6. Usually the Hearth's bond is enough to allow for venting as well as controlled releases of build up magic, but ice, water, and other means of staying cool are also in play
7. Well technically the "end product" of the magic's effect on a human body is being turned into a Hollow - a husk-like zombie-like shell of a being
8. A Hollow isn’t undead in the usual sense. That implies animation, will, or purpose. This is worse. Magical collapse = total loss of soul containment. What remains is: A body whose tissues have been thermally vitrified from the inside out. A mind erased by overload. A shell still moving because the residual soul-heat hasn’t dissipated yet. Think: walking burnout, not necromancy.
9. The Collapse Timeline
Stage 1: Overheat (The Burnups) Chronic fever, ash coughing Skin cracking like fired clay Emotional flattening (empathy burns off early) Fire responds too easily People at this stage know what’s coming. This is where the quote hits: “I could be so much worse.” They still can choose restraint.
Stage 2: Breach One moment too much: A stored surge A panicked release A battlefield spike The soul-boundary fails. This is not an explosion. Explosions release energy outward. This is an implosion that's powerful enough to hit the outside too. Memory, identity, intent — gone, into the <a data-href="GREY MIST" href="lore/world/grey-mist.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">GREY MIST</a>.
Stage 3: Hollowing Organs char but don’t fail completely Blood thickens into slag Nerves fire randomly from thermal stress The heart becomes a smouldering knot The person is already dead. The body just hasn’t realized it yet.
Stage 4: The Hollow Walks A Hollow: Avoids nothing Attacks nothing deliberately Moves toward thermal gradients — crowds, fires, battlefields Why? Because residual soul-heat seeks other heat to equalize with. Hollows drift toward the living. That’s why they’re exterminated on sight. Moral Baseline Shift When everyone knows: Collapse is possible Hollows exist And they were people yesterday The moral bar drops. “I’m a liar. I’m a cheat. But I haven’t collapsed.” That’s enough. Bravery gets you: Overexertion Battlefield surges Collapse Cowards: Flee early Hoard less power Survive.
There is no redemption in collapse. No lesson. No chosen fate.
A Hollow isn’t punished, sinful, or unworthy.
They’re what happens when the system fails. Just as Dangerous (For Different Reasons)
Uncontrolled release doesn’t just burn the caster — it disturbs the local atmosphere.
Side effects: Fire behaving wrong (screaming flames, fire that resembles faces) Attracting Hollows Creating permanent hot zones

They set up facilities of cold stone and water to allow for safe venting, as well as taking in the "terminal" cases, which they handle out back.
They wear layered uniforms, like toxic hazard workers. High-status, low-life-expectancy, trained to read early collapse signs.

Hell isn’t full because too many people sinned - That’s propaganda. Hell is full because it was designed as a furnace, a bottleneck for the deceased, not the final destination. Souls entered Hell to be broken down, identity stripped, meaning burned off, residual energy vented safely.
At some point: The inflow exceeded processing capacity Or the furnace mechanisms failed Or Hell was damaged during a metaphysical war Doesn’t matter which. The result is the same.
Hell stopped processing souls and started storing them.
Consequences?
Pressure builds, exhaust backs up, heat leaks. That leak is magic.

Low fantasy: magic is ubiquitous but weakened. People usually know someone who uses it for something more, but almost nobody can use it Well - in a controlled manner, while retaining power. Most common folk have a hard time with just one of these dimensions. Anyone can light a torch with a flick of their fingers, but someone with enough aptitude and strength to cast a ray of fire is one in a hundred, and those who survive it are one in a thousand. Dark Fantasy: The world is undoubtably a "Bad Place to Be in". People assume the worst in people, The weather usually sucks, and it is dangerous "out there" even for Embers. The environment is hostile, often shrouded in the <a data-href="GREY MIST" href="lore/world/grey-mist.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">GREY MIST</a>, making travel suicidal without the light of a Hearth.

Status: Regional hub, not a capital
Age: Old enough to be layered with mistakes The Look &amp; Tech Level (Dieselgrim, Not Fancy)
Power &amp; Light
Central oil-fired generator complex (“The Heartstack”)
Network of steam pipes and fuel lines
Lantern pylons every 30–50 meters
Street lights burn 24/7
Backup braziers in every district
Blackouts are not tolerated.
Executions have happened over “maintenance failures.”
Architecture
Stone lower floors (fire resistance)
Iron-framed upper levels
Narrow streets to reduce Mist pooling
Wide, well-lit plazas as thermal relief zones
Everything smells faintly of:
Oil
Ash
Hot metal
No wood unless treated. The Grey Mist Situation
Brightfall exists in a Mist basin.
Inside the City
Light keeps the Mist thin but never gone
Morning fog is not normal fog
Citizens wear scarves or filter masks as habit
Children are taught:
“If you can’t see the lantern across the street, you go home.”
Outside the Walls
Mist thickens within minutes
Sound dampens
Fire behaves erratically
Road markers are lit constantly
Travelers arrive shaken, coughing, or wrong. Food &amp; Survival (This Is Where Grimdark Gets Mundane)
Food Sources
Root vegetables (grown underground with heat lamps)
Fungal farms (Mist-tolerant strains)
River fish (considered risky but protein-rich)
Preserved meats (smoked heavily)
Fresh fruit is:
Rare
Expensive
Considered medicinal
Food Safety
Cooking isn’t just culinary.
It’s sterilization:
Heat kills Mist residue
Raw food is taboo
Fireless meals are distrusted
Starvation kills fewer people than cold contamination. Living Conditions (Class Is Measured in Degrees)
Upper Districts
Close to Heartstack
Bright, dry, noisy
Lower Mist exposure
Expensive rents
Ember housing heavily regulated
These people live longer.
Lower Districts
Near walls or old burn zones
Lantern gaps
Thicker Mist
Higher collapse rates
Slums aren’t lawless.
They’re thermally neglected. Embers, Hearths &amp; City Infrastructure
Hearth Registry
Every Hearth in Brightfall is:
Registered
Assigned inspection dates
Required to attend cooling rites
Unregistered Hearths are illegal.
Not immoral. Illegal.
Release Infrastructure
Three public release halls
One military-only vent tower
Countless illegal micro-vents in slums
Public release days are tense but routine.
Think:
Long lines
Silent prayers
Fire crews on standby Internal Security (Order Is Non-Negotiable)
City Watch
Heavily equipped with:
Fire-resistant gear
Cooling rods
Mist dispersal grenades
They are trained less to fight people and more to contain events.
Collapse Response Units
Separate from the Watch.
Rapid deployment
Authorized to kill without trial
Tasked with isolating Hollow events
Everyone hates them.
Everyone wants them nearby. Religion &amp; Public Space
Dominant Faith: The Vigil of Ash
Core beliefs:
Light is duty
Fire is burden
Collapse is failure of care, not sin
Temples double as:
Lantern hubs
Cooling shelters
Hearth bonding sites
Priests carry thermometers and ledgers. Government &amp; Politics
Governance Model
Council of Fuel, Light, and Watch
No single ruler
All decisions filtered through risk impact
Democracy exists in theory.
In practice:
The lanterns decide.
Taxes
Paid in:
Coin
Fuel
Mandatory service rotations
Miss fuel tax and your district dims.
People notice. External Relations
Trade
Fuel imports (critical)
Export: treated metals, vented slag, trained personnel
Brightfall sells:
people who know how to survive fire.
Diplomacy
Neighbors tolerate Brightfall because:
It maintains roads
It clears Mist paths
It handles Cinders that wander too close
In exchange:
Tribute fuel
Political leverage The Cult Problem (Because Of Course)
The Great Hearth Movement has cells in Brightfall.
Current Status
Officially banned
Quietly persistent
Recruiting among:
Embers
Slum dwellers
Collapse survivors
They believe Brightfall is:
“A model city—ready to be unified.”
The city council is aware.
They are terrified. Daily Life (The Human Bit)
People:
Walk briskly
Avoid emotional outbursts
Keep lantern oil on hand
Don’t gather in darkness
Children play games about:
Keeping fires balanced
“Don’t burn your friends”
Love exists.
It’s just… careful.
Final Snapshot
Brightfall isn’t heroic.
It isn’t evil.
It’s working.
Which, in this world, is the closest thing to hope.
Currency &amp; Economy: Heat Is the Real Backing
Forget gold standards. Gold doesn’t vent.
What Money Actually Represents
Currency is backed by:
Light
Fuel
Containment capacity
The more you can keep places lit and people cooled, the more stable your economy.
Common forms:
Fuel chits (oil, tallow, treated coal)
Lantern credits
Release vouchers (dangerously valuable)
Heat-ration tokens for Embers
Counterfeiting isn’t about metal. It’s about lying about safety.
Wealth Is Distance From Heat
Rich people:
Live in well-lit districts
Far from release sites
Surrounded by stone, water, and warding
Poor people:
Live in the Mist
Near old burn zones
Serve as accidental heat sinks
Class isn’t abstract. It’s thermal. Values &amp; Philosophy: Restraint Over Virtue
Heroism gets you killed.
Core Cultural Virtues
Self-control
Cowardice (rebranded as prudence)
Predictability
Collective risk minimization
People don’t ask: “Is it right?”
They ask:
“Will this raise the temperature?” Common Saying “Don’t be a spark.”
That’s an insult. Religion: Containment, Not Salvation
Most religions gave up on after.
Now they deal with before.
Mainstream Doctrine
The soul is a liability
Life is a containment exercise
Death is a failure to manage residue
Priests:
Maintain lanterns
Bless release chambers
Conduct cooling rites
Keep records of dangerous lineages
Confession isn’t for forgiveness.
It’s for risk assessment. Heresies (Popular Ones)
Hell can be repaired
Collapse is transcendence
Fire purifies (these people don’t last) Government: Risk Management With Bad Optics
States don’t rule.
They mitigate.
Core State Functions
Light infrastructure
Ember registry
Hearth licensing
Collapse response units
Cinder extermination
Elections, crowns, councils — flavor.
The real power is whoever controls:
Fuel
Release sites
Bonding rites Martial Law Is Permanent
Not dramatic. Routine.
Nobody riots over curfews.
They riot over lantern outages. ]]></description><link>lore/world/locations/case-study.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">LORE/WORLD/LOCATIONS/CASE STUDY.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:39:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[THE EARTHBOUND]]></title><description><![CDATA[These zealots believe in extremist pacifism, claiming that every life spared and death delayed brings HELL closer to catching up, and ridding the world of magic and <a data-href="GREY MIST" href="lore/world/grey-mist.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">GREY MIST</a>.]]></description><link>lore/world/fractions/the-earthbound.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">LORE/WORLD/FRACTIONS/THE EARTHBOUND.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:28:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[IGNITE]]></title><description><![CDATA[Deal 1 DMG at the end of the enemy's turn, then decrease stacks by 1.
