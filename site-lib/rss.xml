Embers without a Hearth, either because of tragedy, or neglect, they suffer alone.
These individuals are a lore thing mostly, meaning - unplayable, and make for great adversaries. Ranging from "Mad geniuses" who "made it work", to individuals broken by trauma, lashing out at the unjust world.
If bonding is so necessary, how do solo adversaries survive?
They consume others. A Cinder doesn't have their Hearth; they seek Fuel. They kidnap low-aptitude people and "burn" through them to stabilize their own <a data-href="LORE/WORLD/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION" href="lore/world/religion-philosophy/erosion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">LORE/WORLD/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION</a>. This gives the players a clear, gritty objective: stop the Cinder from using the local village as a life support.
Cinder Status:&nbsp;If Cinders "lose their grip on reality," perhaps they are actually still "perceiving" the bond. They might be trying to talk to the ghosts of their former Hearth-mates, or their brains are permanently wired to receive signals that are no longer being sent.
7. Why They’re Exceptionally Powerful
Power isn’t skill.
It’s lack of restraint mechanisms.
No bond damping
No social checks
No institutional oversight
No long-term planning
They burn hot, fast, and wrong.
And they know it.
Which makes them terrifyingly honest. ]]></description><link>lore/cinders.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">LORE/CINDERS.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:37:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[HEARTHS AND EMBERS]]></title><description><![CDATA[People with spiked Prism aptitudes. The cost of power is life. Embers suffer a shortened lifespan, burning their years away the moment this flame blooms within them for the first time. Despite that, it's a gift, one that manifests randomly and powerfully, and comes at a horrid price.
Players are called Embers, groups of bonded Embers are called Hearths. This bond acts as a "Resonance Buffer," preventing the individuals from "detonating" or collapsing into a Hollow state.
Hearths can form due to: Rituals done by the Embers themselves, or even without the Embers' choice/knowledge via grimoires or other artifacts.
Life experiences: a Bond is likely to form during a shared traumatic event, or, for the lucky ones, it can build up after years of closeness with one another. Bonding with other Embers allows for cleaner channelling - which translates nicely into extra energy per party member.
Because Embers forget their pasts (due to <a data-href="LORE/WORLD/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION" href="lore/world/religion-philosophy/erosion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">LORE/WORLD/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION</a>), they often lack a traditional moral compass. They act on instinct, immediate survival, or the orders of whoever is currently guiding them. Partially. Hearth-members (Embers) are known to have blurry memories and little recollection of who they were before the "merge". The bond between them can also be strengthened or weakened by individual interactions, even to the point of breaking (which is a traumatic experience on its own)
Everyone in a hearth is a bit of an anchor to everyone else. Usually the other members are enough to "ground" whoever's having a tough time, but in times of high stress the emotions may get amplified/cascaded
<br>Yes! It is rare to survive a bond breaking, but those who do are called <a data-href="Cinders" href="lore/cinders.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cinders</a>, and often lose their grip on reality, turning away from society altogether
Probably the second one. I'd imagine them being like social programs, which quickly turn into military ones
The most impressive and threatening Embers are those who can output the most, at the smallest cost to their vitals
The "Ship of Theseus" Dilemma:&nbsp;If a Hearth replaces a member who died, does the new member eventually "absorb" the residual memories of the previous occupant? This could lead to haunting internal monologues where an Ember cannot distinguish their own childhood from that of a dead stranger.
Cascading Failure:&nbsp;If emotions are amplified/cascaded during stress, a single member’s panic attack could theoretically "overclock" the entire Hearth, leading to a collective burnup. This makes emotional discipline as vital as magical talent.
Hearths: Distributed Containment (And Why 3–5 Is the Sweet Spot)
A Hearth is a living heat-sharing network.
Soul-binding isn’t mystical romance. It’s engineering under duress.
Why It Works (When It Does)
Heat disperses across multiple vessels
Panic dampens if others are stable
Emotional regulation is forced by proximity
Individual spikes become manageable averages
You didn’t choose 3–5 by accident. That’s perfect:
2 is unstable (feedback loop)
6+ increases coordination failure
3–5 balances redundancy and control
Someone absolutely did the math. On corpses. ]]></description><link>lore/hearths-and-embers.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">LORE/HEARTHS AND EMBERS.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:35:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EROSION]]></title><description><![CDATA[Magic doesn’t want to be inside you.
5. Actually veins, fingernails, and even eyes may begin glowing in red/yellow hues. That's the usual sign of magic accumulation, which, if left untreated, can cause burnups ("treating it" means releasing the magic outward, which itself has a chance for burning the person, but also their surroundings if uncontrolled)
6. Usually the Hearth's bond is enough to allow for venting as well as controlled releases of build up magic, but ice, water, and other means of staying cool are also in play
7. Well technically the "end product" of the magic's effect on a human body is being turned into a Hollow - a husk-like zombie-like shell of a being
8. A Hollow isn’t undead in the usual sense. That implies animation, will, or purpose. This is worse. Magical collapse = total loss of soul containment. What remains is: A body whose tissues have been thermally vitrified from the inside out. A mind erased by overload. A shell still moving because the residual soul-heat hasn’t dissipated yet. Think: walking burnout, not necromancy.
9. The Collapse Timeline
Stage 1: Overheat (The Burnups) Chronic fever, ash coughing Skin cracking like fired clay Emotional flattening (empathy burns off early) Fire responds too easily People at this stage know what’s coming. This is where the quote hits: “I could be so much worse.” They still can choose restraint.
Stage 2: Breach One moment too much: A stored surge A panicked release A battlefield spike The soul-boundary fails. This is not an explosion. Explosions release energy outward. This is an implosion that's powerful enough to hit the outside too. Memory, identity, intent — gone, into the <a data-href="GREY MIST" href="lore/world/grey-mist.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">GREY MIST</a>.
Stage 3: Hollowing Organs char but don’t fail completely Blood thickens into slag Nerves fire randomly from thermal stress The heart becomes a smouldering knot The person is already dead. The body just hasn’t realized it yet.
Stage 4: The Hollow Walks A Hollow: Avoids nothing Attacks nothing deliberately Moves toward thermal gradients — crowds, fires, battlefields Why? Because residual soul-heat seeks other heat to equalize with. Hollows drift toward the living. That’s why they’re exterminated on sight. Moral Baseline Shift When everyone knows: Collapse is possible Hollows exist And they were people yesterday The moral bar drops. “I’m a liar. I’m a cheat. But I haven’t collapsed.” That’s enough. Bravery gets you: Overexertion Battlefield surges Collapse Cowards: Flee early Hoard less power Survive.
There is no redemption in collapse. No lesson. No chosen fate.
A Hollow isn’t punished, sinful, or unworthy.
They’re what happens when the system fails. Just as Dangerous (For Different Reasons)
Uncontrolled release doesn’t just burn the caster — it disturbs the local atmosphere.
Side effects: Fire behaving wrong (screaming flames, fire that resembles faces) Attracting Hollows Creating permanent hot zones

Hell isn’t full because too many people sinned - That’s propaganda. Hell is full because it was designed as a furnace, a bottleneck for the deceased, not the final destination. Souls entered Hell to be broken down, identity stripped, meaning burned off, residual energy vented safely.
At some point: The inflow exceeded processing capacity Or the furnace mechanisms failed Or Hell was damaged during a metaphysical war Doesn’t matter which. The result is the same.
Hell stopped processing souls and started storing them.
Consequences?

Every Hearth in Brightfall is:
Registered
Assigned inspection dates
Required to attend cooling rites
Unregistered Hearths are illegal.
Not immoral. Illegal.
Release Infrastructure
Three public release halls
One military-only vent tower
Countless illegal micro-vents in slums
Public release days are tense but routine.

Final Snapshot
Brightfall isn’t heroic.
It isn’t evil.

Which, in this world, is the closest thing to hope.
Currency &amp; Economy: Heat Is the Real Backing
Forget gold standards. Gold doesn’t vent.

Containment capacity
The more you can keep places lit and people cooled, the more stable your economy.
Common forms:
Fuel chits (oil, tallow, treated coal)

Counterfeiting isn’t about metal. It’s about lying about safety.
Wealth Is Distance From Heat
Rich people:
Live in well-lit districts
Far from release sites

That’s an insult. Religion: Containment, Not Salvation
Most religions gave up on after.
Now they deal with before.
Mainstream Doctrine
The soul is a liability
Life is a containment exercise
Death is a failure to manage residue

It was an idea heavily inspired by gems such as "Slay The Spire", "Hearthstone", and "Morimens".
The gameplay features tight resource management in a low-math, high-keyword environment, giving a couple of anchor points to make your own character and their deck unique and powerful, whereas the Setting provides plenty of opportunity for "angsty" or "against all odds" roleplay in a grimdark world, where magic is ubiquitous, but hope is scant.Using Pixar's brilliant storytelling formula: Once upon a time, there was HELL. Every day, souls passed in and out, getting incinerated and sent to the Hall of Echoes pure. One day an apocalyptic event happened. Because of that, HELL is working overtime and is still centuries behind. Because of that, Souls get clogged up in the in-between, and that radiation is called magic, which seeps into the living. Until finally, their bodies can't take it anymore, and burn up from the inside.The LORE dropdown is a good place to start for anyone curious about the world and the gritty reality found therein, ex.: <a data-href="VIBE" href="lore/world/vibe.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">VIBE</a>.
For the Rules Lawyers: here's the short end of it, as the detailed rulings fall under their own dropdowns, labelled BS, DS, or CHARACTER.Once a concept of who you'd like to play as forms in your mind, the preferable place to go is the CHARACTER&gt;OATHS Section, where you'll find all three major Oaths (which function like classes, and determine your starting Attributes - Prisms), these in turn determine your Starting Deck.<br>
All Oaths start with 10 <a data-href="BACKBONE" href="character/cards/backbone.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">BACKBONE</a>cards making up their deck, but the keywords may vary based on chosen Oath and even subtle differences between the same Oath's decks are possible at times.<br>
Now, having a concept, embodied by an Oath, and a Deck, you select your <a data-href="BURST" href="character/oaths/burst.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">BURST</a>, and your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="CHARACTER/OATHS/CRUCIBLE/PASSIVES" data-href="CHARACTER/OATHS/CRUCIBLE/PASSIVES" href="character/oaths/crucible/passives.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PASSIVES</a> (Each Oath offers a different selection). These are the anchor points mentioned before - they'll define your playstyle heavily.
Once that's in order, and your friends have done the same, you're set!

This allows the GM to create "impossible" threats that require specific card or behaviour answers.
An enemy's "Statblock" is essentially their Intent Loop/Algorithm + their HP.
Ex.:
Husk - 7 HP
Intent: Strike (6) -&gt; Guard (8) -&gt; Strike (8) -&gt; Guard (12) -&gt; LOOP.
This makes enemies predictable (rewards knowledge/experience and learning), and decreases GM's mental load drastically, while keeping the players on their toes whenever they meet something new.
