Deck is a project still in early development, so this site may update and look unrecognisable after the fact!Said plainly, Ember Deck is a TTRPG Deckbuilder made for (ideally) 3-4 Player groups, but it should still scale relatively well until about 5-6 people. It was an idea heavily inspired by gems such as \"Slay The Spire\", \"Hearthstone\", \"Slice and Dice\", and \"Morimens\".\nThe gameplay features tight resource management in a low-math, high-keyword environment, giving a couple of anchor points to make your own character and their deck unique and powerful, whereas the Setting provides plenty of opportunity for \"angsty\" or \"against all odds\" roleplay in a grimdark world, where magic is ubiquitous, but hope is scant.Once, there was HELL. Every day, souls passed in and out, getting incinerated and sent to the Hall of Echoes, pure. One day an apocalyptic event happened. Because of that, HELL is working overtime and is still centuries behind. Because of that, Souls get clogged up in the in-between, and that radiation is called magic, which seeps into the living. Until finally, their bodies can't take it anymore, and burn up from the inside.*The LORE dropdown is a good place to start for anyone curious about the world and the gritty reality found therein, ex.: <a data-href=\"VIBE\" href=\"lore/world/vibe.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VIBE</a>.\nFor the Rules Lawyers: here's the short end of it, as the detailed rulings fall under their own dropdowns, labelled BS, DS, or CHARACTER.Once a concept of who you'd like to play as forms in your mind, the preferable place to go is the CHARACTER&gt;OATHS Section, where you'll find all three major Oaths (which function like classes, and determine your starting Attributes - Prisms), these in turn determine your Starting Deck.<br>\nAll Oaths start with 10 <a data-href=\"BACKBONE\" href=\"character/cards/backbone.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BACKBONE</a> cards making up their deck, but the keywords may vary based on chosen Oath and even subtle differences between the same Oath's decks are possible at times.<br>\nNow, having a concept, embodied by an Oath, and a Deck, you select your <a data-href=\"BURST\" href=\"character/oaths/burst.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BURST</a>, and your <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"CHARACTER/OATHS/PYRE/PASSIVES\" data-href=\"CHARACTER/OATHS/PYRE/PASSIVES\" href=\"character/oaths/pyre/passives.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PASSIVES</a> (Each Oath offers a different selection). These are the anchor points mentioned before - they'll define your playstyle heavily.\nOnce that's in order, and your friends have done the same, you're set!\n(Don't forget to send at least 4 sentences worth of a backstory to your GM, though.)\nChanged Keyword function and Naming: <br><a data-href=\"Empower\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/primary/empower.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empower</a> -&gt; <a data-href=\"Momentum\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/primary/momentum.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Momentum</a>. <br><a data-href=\"Empower\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/primary/empower.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empower</a> was Changed to provide a readily accessible pool instead of a small trickle.\n<br><a data-href=\"Brace\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/primary/brace.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Brace</a> was updated to mirror this change. <br><a data-href=\"Focus\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Focus</a> -&gt; <a data-href=\"Empower\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/primary/empower.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Empower</a>.\n<br><a data-href=\"Delay\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Delay</a> was Removed.\n<br><a data-href=\"Ward\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/tertiary/ward.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ward</a> now scales with Insight and prevents enemy keywords as well as statuses. <br>Added <a data-href=\"IMAGES\" href=\"character/images.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">IMAGES</a> sections across the vault to provide visuals.\n<br><a data-href=\"CASE STUDY\" href=\"lore/world/physical-pillar/locations/case-study.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CASE STUDY</a> was removed for cleanup\nCertain notes have received related images inside the notes\n<br><a data-href=\"CINDERS\" href=\"lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/cinders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CINDERS</a>, and, <a data-href=\"HEARTHS AND EMBERS\" href=\"lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/hearths-and-embers.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">HEARTHS AND EMBERS</a> were moved to the FRACTIONS dropdown\n<br>The <a data-href=\"SYNC-AXIS\" href=\"ds-(during-stabbings)/playerside/sync-axis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">SYNC-AXIS</a> is now more firmly tied to combat through the updated <a data-href=\"EMPOWER\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/primary/empower.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">EMPOWER</a>and <a data-href=\"BRACE\" href=\"character/cards/keywords/primary/brace.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BRACE</a> keywords\n<br><a data-href=\"BURST\" href=\"character/oaths/burst.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BURST</a> note was corrected, showing an improved formula for post-burst draw calculation\n<br><a data-href=\"INVENTORY\" href=\"character/inventory.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">INVENTORY</a> section was brushed up, adding needed specifications and removing unnecessary repetitions.

The cost of power is life. Embers suffer a shortened lifespan, burning their years away the moment this flame blooms within them for the first time. Despite that, it's a gift, one that manifests randomly and powerfully, and comes at a horrid price.\nPlayers are called Embers, groups of bonded Embers are called Hearths. This bond acts as a \"Resonance Buffer,\" preventing the individuals from \"detonating\" or collapsing into a Hollow state.\nHearths can form due to: Rituals done by the Embers themselves, or even without the Embers' choice/knowledge via grimoires or other artifacts.\nLife experiences: a Bond is likely to form during a shared traumatic event, or, for the lucky ones, it can build up after years of closeness with one another. Bonding with other Embers allows for cleaner channelling - which translates nicely into extra energy per party member.\nBecause Embers forget their pasts (due to <a data-href=\"LORE/WORLD/CULTURAL PILLAR/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION\" href=\"lore/world/cultural-pillar/religion-philosophy/erosion.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LORE/WORLD/CULTURAL PILLAR/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION</a>), they often lack a traditional moral compass. They act on instinct, immediate survival, or the orders of whoever is currently guiding them. Partially. Hearth-members (Embers) are known to have blurry memories and little recollection of who they were before the \"merge\". The bond between them can also be strengthened or weakened by individual interactions, even to the point of breaking (which is a traumatic experience on its own)\nEveryone in a hearth is a bit of an anchor to everyone else. Usually the other members are enough to \"ground\" whoever's having a tough time, but in times of high stress the emotions may get amplified/cascaded\n<br>Yes! It is rare to survive a bond breaking, but those who do are called <a data-href=\"CINDERS\" href=\"lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/cinders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CINDERS</a>, and often lose their grip on reality, turning away from society altogether\nProbably the second one. I'd imagine them being like social programs, which quickly turn into military ones\nThe most impressive and threatening Embers are those who can output the most, at the smallest cost to their vitals\nThe \"Ship of Theseus\" Dilemma:&nbsp;If a Hearth replaces a member who died, does the new member eventually \"absorb\" the residual memories of the previous occupant? This could lead to haunting internal monologues where an Ember cannot distinguish their own childhood from that of a dead stranger.\nCascading Failure:&nbsp;If emotions are amplified/cascaded during stress, a single member’s panic attack could theoretically \"overclock\" the entire Hearth, leading to a collective burnup. This makes emotional discipline as vital as magical talent.\nHearths: Distributed Containment (And Why 3–5 Is the Sweet Spot)\nA Hearth is a living heat-sharing network.\nSoul-binding isn’t mystical romance. It’s engineering under duress.\nWhy It Works (When It Does)\nHeat disperses across multiple vessels\nPanic dampens if others are stable\nEmotional regulation is forced by proximity\nIndividual spikes become manageable averages\nYou didn’t choose 3–5 by accident. That’s perfect:\n2 is unstable (feedback loop)\n6+ increases coordination failure\n3–5 balances redundancy and control\nSomeone absolutely did the math. On corpses.

Veins, fingernails, and even eyes may begin glowing in red/yellow hues. That's the usual sign of magic accumulation, which, if left untreated, can cause burnups (\"treating it\" means releasing the magic outward, which itself has a chance for burning the person, but also their surroundings if uncontrolled)\nUsually the Hearth's bond is enough to allow for venting as well as controlled releases of build up magic, but ice, water, and other means of staying cool are also in play\nThe \"end product\" of the magic's effect on a human body is being turned into a Hollow - a husk-like zombie-like shell of a being A Hollow isn’t undead in the usual sense. That implies animation, will, or purpose. This is worse. Magical collapse = total loss of soul containment. What remains is: A body whose tissues have been thermally vitrified from the inside out. A mind erased by overload. A shell still moving because the residual soul-heat hasn’t dissipated yet.\nThe Collapse Timeline\nStage 1: The Burnups Chronic fever, ash coughing Skin cracking like fired clay Emotional flattening\nFire responds too easily People at this stage know what’s coming.\nStage 2: Breach One moment too much: A stored surge A panicked release A battlefield spike The soul-boundary fails.

Because residual soul-heat seeks other heat to equalize with. Hollows drift toward the living. That’s why they’re exterminated on sight. Moral Baseline Shift When everyone knows: Collapse is possible Hollows exist And they were people yesterday The moral bar drops. “I’m a liar. I’m a cheat. But I haven’t collapsed.” That’s enough.
