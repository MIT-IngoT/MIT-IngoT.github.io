Deck is a project still in early development, so this site may update and look unrecognisable after the fact!Said plainly, Ember Deck is a TTRPG Deckbuilder made for (ideally) 3-4 Player groups, but it should still scale relatively well until about 5-6 people. It was an idea heavily inspired by gems such as \"Slay The Spire\", \"Hearthstone\", \"Slice and Dice\", and \"Morimens\".\nThe gameplay features tight resource management in a low-math, high-keyword environment, giving a couple of anchor points to make your own character and their deck unique and powerful, whereas the Setting provides plenty of opportunity for \"angsty\" or \"against all odds\" roleplay in a grimdark world, where magic is ubiquitous, but hope is scant.Once, there was HELL. Every day, souls passed in and out, getting incinerated and sent to the Hall of Echoes, pure. One day an apocalyptic event happened. Because of that, HELL is working overtime and is still centuries behind. Because of that, Souls get clogged up in the in-between, and that radiation is called magic, which seeps into the living. Until finally, their bodies can't take it anymore, and burn up from the inside.*The LORE dropdown is a good place to start for anyone curious about the world and the gritty reality found therein, ex.: <a data-href=\"VIBE\" href=\"lore/world/vibe.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">VIBE</a>.\nFor the Rules Lawyers: here's the short end of it, as the detailed rulings fall under their own dropdowns, labelled BS, DS, or CHARACTER.Once a concept of who you'd like to play as forms in your mind, the preferable place to go is the CHARACTER&gt;OATHS Section, where you'll find all three major Oaths (which function like classes, and determine your starting Attributes - Prisms), these in turn determine your Starting Deck.<br>\nAll Oaths start with 10 <a data-href=\"BACKBONE\" href=\"character/cards/backbone.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BACKBONE</a> cards making up their deck, but the keywords may vary based on chosen Oath and even subtle differences between the same Oath's decks are possible at times.<br>\nNow, having a concept, embodied by an Oath, and a Deck, you select your <a data-href=\"BURST\" href=\"character/oaths/burst.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BURST</a>, and your <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"CHARACTER/OATHS/PYRE/PASSIVES\" data-href=\"CHARACTER/OATHS/PYRE/PASSIVES\" href=\"character/oaths/pyre/passives.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">PASSIVES</a> (Each Oath offers a different selection).

This bond acts as a \"Resonance Buffer,\" preventing the individuals from \"detonating\" or collapsing into a Hollow state.\nHearths can form due to: Rituals done by the Embers themselves, or even without the Embers' choice/knowledge via grimoires or other artifacts.\nLife experiences: a Bond is likely to form during a shared traumatic event, or, for the lucky ones, it can build up after years of closeness with one another.

Veins, fingernails, and even eyes may begin glowing in red/yellow hues. That's the usual sign of magic accumulation, which, if left untreated, can cause burnups (\"treating it\" means releasing the magic outward, which itself has a chance for burning the person, but also their surroundings if uncontrolled)\nUsually the Hearth's bond is enough to allow for venting as well as controlled releases of build up magic, but ice, water, and other means of staying cool are also in play\nThe \"end product\" of the magic's effect on a human body is being turned into a Hollow - a husk-like zombie-like shell of a being A Hollow isn’t undead in the usual sense. That implies animation, will, or purpose. This is worse. Magical collapse = total loss of soul containment. What remains is: A body whose tissues have been thermally vitrified from the inside out. A mind erased by overload. A shell still moving because the residual soul-heat hasn’t dissipated yet.\nThe Collapse Timeline\nStage 1: The Burnups Chronic fever, ash coughing Skin cracking like fired clay Emotional flattening\nFire responds too easily People at this stage know what’s coming.\nStage 2: Breach One moment too much: A stored surge A panicked release A battlefield spike The soul-boundary fails. This is not an explosion. Explosions release energy outward. This is an implosion that's powerful enough to hit the outside too. Memory, identity, intent — gone, into the <a data-href=\"GREY MIST\" href=\"lore/world/physical-pillar/grey-mist.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">GREY MIST</a>.\nStage 3: Hollowing (fractions of a second after Breach)\nOrgans char but don’t fail completely Blood thickens into slag Nerves fire randomly from thermal stress The heart becomes a smouldering knot The person is already dead. The body just hasn’t realized it yet.\nStage 4: The Hollow Walks A Hollow: Avoids nothing Attacks nothing deliberately Moves toward thermal gradients — crowds, fires, battlefields Why? Because residual soul-heat seeks other heat to equalize with. Hollows drift toward the living. That’s why they’re exterminated on sight. Moral Baseline Shift When everyone knows: Collapse is possible Hollows exist And they were people yesterday The moral bar drops. “I’m a liar. I’m a cheat. But I haven’t collapsed.” That’s enough. Bravery gets you: Overexertion Battlefield surges Collapse Cowards: Flee early Hoard less power Survive.\nThere is no redemption in collapse. No lesson. No chosen fate.\nA Hollow isn’t punished, sinful, or unworthy.\nThey’re what happens when the system fails.<br>\n<img alt=\"fc22c17508b307fac4aae6c0bf3590b3 3.jpg\" src=\"im/fc22c17508b307fac4aae6c0bf3590b3-3.jpg\" target=\"_self\"> <br><img alt=\"6234ef13f4488f2737abf49843850fe7 2.jpg\" src=\"im/6234ef13f4488f2737abf49843850fe7-2.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img alt=\"8ac1441d551344c04b92f02668179b89 2.jpg\" src=\"im/8ac1441d551344c04b92f02668179b89-2.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img alt=\"fb61eb48dca274c2f2a470848fc100f5 2.jpg\" src=\"im/fb61eb48dca274c2f2a470848fc100f5-2.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Just as Dangerous (For Different Reasons)\nUncontrolled release doesn’t just burn the caster — it disturbs the local atmosphere.\nSide effects: Fire behaving wrong (screaming flames, fire that resembles faces) Attracting Hollows Creating permanent hot zones<br>\n<img alt=\"9c6040031ed9cfc76b7807aeb529086b.jpg\" src=\"im/9c6040031ed9cfc76b7807aeb529086b.jpg\" target=\"_self\">\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"EROSION","level":1,"id":"EROSION_1"},{"heading":"RELEASE","level":1,"id":"RELEASE_0"}],"links":["lore/world/physical-pillar/grey-mist.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"lore/world/cultural-pillar/religion-philosophy/erosion.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["im/fc22c17508b307fac4aae6c0bf3590b3-3.jpg","im/6234ef13f4488f2737abf49843850fe7-2.jpg","im/8ac1441d551344c04b92f02668179b89-2.jpg","im/fb61eb48dca274c2f2a470848fc100f5-2.jpg","im/9c6040031ed9cfc76b7807aeb529086b.jpg"],"createdTime":1767125662821,"modifiedTime":1768573159054,"sourceSize":3283,"sourcePath":"LORE/WORLD/CULTURAL PILLAR/RELIGION-PHILOSOPHY/EROSION.md","exportPath":"lore/world/cultural-pillar/religion-philosophy/erosion.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":84,"backlinks":["lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/crs.html","lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/hearths-and-embers.html","lore/world/cultural-pillar/fractions/cinders.html","lore/world/cultural-pillar/religion-philosophy/hell.html","lore/world/physical-pillar/grey-mist.html"],"type":"markdown"},"lore/world/cultural-pillar/religion-philosophy/hell.html":{"title":"HELL","icon":"","description":"Why Hell Is Full:\nHell isn’t full because too many people sinned - That’s propaganda.
